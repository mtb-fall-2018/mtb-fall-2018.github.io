# Gleick on Sumerian

<hr>

"[T]he first language to be written ... left no other traces in culture or speech. Sumerian turned out to be a linguistic rarity, an isolate, with no known descendents.
When scholars did learn to read the Uruk tablets, they found them to be, in their way, humdrum: civic memoranda, contracts and laws,
and bills for barley, livestock, oil, reed mats, and pottery" (42).

# Gleick on Clay Tablets

<hr>

"Their mathematics seemed to value computational power above all. ... This could not be appreciated until computational power began to mean something" (45)

- #### Donald Knuth, 1972, defined their computations as early algorithms
- #### More like contemporary computers than the math of Greece or Rome

# From <em>Snow Crash</em>
##### by Neal Stephenson

> "Egypt was a civilization of stone. They made their art and architecture of stone, so it lasts forever. But you can't write on stone. So they invented papyrus and wrote on that. But papyrus is perishable. So even though their art and architecture have survived, their written records -- their data -- have largely disappeared."
<br></br>
> "What about all those hieroglyphic inscriptions?"
<br></br>
> "Bumper stickers, Lagos called them. Corrupt political speech. They had an unfortunate tendency to write inscriptions praising their own military victories before the battles had actually taken place?'
<br></br>
> "And Sumer is different?"
<br></br>
> "Sumer was a civilization of clay. They made their buildings of it and wrote on it, too. Their statues were of gypsum, which dissolves in water. So the buildings and statues have since fallen apart under the elements. But the clay tablets were either baked or else buried in jars. So all the data of the Sumerians have survived. Egypt left a legacy of art and architecture; Sumer's legacy is its megabytes."
